# INTRODUCTION TO POWER AMPLIFIERS
An amplifier system consists of signal pickup transducer followed by small signal amplifiers,a large signal amplifier and output transducer.A transducer is used to convert one form of energy to another type.Power amplifiers is defined as the device which converts **dc power** to **ac power** and whose action is controlled by the *input signal*.The Transistors employed in power amplifiers are called ***Power Transistors***.They differ from other transistors in following aspects:
> 1.The base is made thicker to handle large currents.
> 2.The area of collector region is made considerabely made large in order to dissipate the heat  developed during the operation.
> 3.The Emitter and base layers are heavly doped.

The power amplifiers are required to deliver a large amount of power and such it has to handle large currents.
## Classification of Power Amplifiers
### Class A Power Amplifiers
In this case transistor is so biased that the output current flows for entire cycle of input signal.Thus the operating point is selected so that the transistor operates only over linear region of its load line. So such amplifier can amplify the input signal of small amplitude. As the transistor operates over linear portion of load line,the output waveform is exactly similar to input waveform. So class A amplifiers are characterised by high fidelity of output.Such amplifier are used when freedom from distortion is prime in operation is restricted only over a small central region of load lines of amplifier can be used for amplitude signals are small aptitude.
> The maximum possible overall efficiency with a resistive load is 25%. 
> The maximum possible collector efficiency with resistive load is 50% .
> In case an output Transformer is used both of the efficiencies are 50%.

### Class B Power Amplifier
The transistor is so biased that the zero signal character current is zero. Hence Class B  operation does not need any biasing system. The operating point is set at cutoff has. It remains forward bias for only half of the input cycle (i.e.  is conduction angle is 180Â° )
 During the Positive half cycle of the input AC signal, the circuit is forward biased therefore collector current flows . On the other hand, during a negative half cycle of the input AC signal, the circuit is reverse biased and no collector current flows.

### Class AB Power Amplifier
In **class AB power amplifiers**, the biasing circuit is so adjusted that the **operating point** lies near the **cutoff voltage**. During a small portion of the negative half cycle and for a complete positive half cycle of the signal, the ***input circuit remains forward biased***, and hence collector current flows. But during a small portion of the ***negative half cycle***, the input circuit is reverse biased, and therefore no collector current flows during this period.


### Class C Power Amplifier
The class C  power amplifier is biased to operate for **less than 180 degrees of input signal cycle** the tuned circuit in the output however will provide a full cycle of the output signal For the fundamental or resonant frequency of the tuned circuit of the output. the use of such frequency is limited for a fixed frequency as occurs in communication circuits.

### Class D Power Amplifier
Class D Power amplifier is designed to **operate with digital or pulse-type signals** using digital techniques making it possible to have a signal that is very over the entire cycle to recreate the output from many pieces of input signal. The main advantage of class the power amplifier is that it is **ON (using power) only for short intervals** and the **overall efficiency** can be practically **very high**(Above 90%).
